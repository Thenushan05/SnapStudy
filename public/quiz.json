  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "Which of the following is a state function?",
      "options": [
        "Work (W)",
        "Heat (Q)",
        "Internal Energy (U)",
        "Power (P)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Internal energy is a state function; it depends only on the state of the system, not the path."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Explain why heat and work are not state functions.",
      "correctAnswer": "Because they depend on the path taken during a process, not just the initial and final states.",
      "explanation": "Heat and work are process-dependent quantities, unlike state functions which depend only on the current state."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "A system loses 50J of heat and has 20J of work done on it. What is the change in internal energy ΔU?",
      "options": ["-70J", "-30J", "30J", "70J"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ΔU = Q - W. Here Q = -50J (lost), W = -20J (done on system? carefully), so ΔU = -50 - (-20) = -30J"
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "type": "flashcard",
      "question": "Define a closed system.",
      "options": [
        "Exchanges energy and matter",
        "Exchanges only energy, not matter",
        "Exchanges only matter, not energy",
        "Exchanges neither energy nor matter"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A closed system can exchange energy (heat/work) with surroundings but not matter."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10",
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "Which quantity is positive when heat is added to a system?",
      "options": [
        "Q",
        "ΔU",
        "W",
        "Entropy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Heat added to the system (Q) is considered positive according to the sign convention."
